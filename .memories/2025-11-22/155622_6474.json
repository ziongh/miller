  "description": "BUG: trace_call_path shows all references as siblings at same depth rather than proper call hierarchy. The trace finds many [Reference] entries but they're not nested by \"which function contains this call\". This suggests containing_symbol_id may not be populated correctly by the extractors, or the trace builder isn't using it to construct the hierarchy. The julie-extractors v1.16.0 update was supposed to fix caller extraction - need to verify identifiers have containing_symbol_id set and trace is using it.",
