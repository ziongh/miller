Shipped lean text output as default for all Miller tools. Implemented grep-style for fast_search, reference lists for fast_refs, definition text for fast_goto, ASCII trees for trace_call_path, and type summaries for fast_explore. Added SQLite hydration for code_context. Committed ed9f346 and pushed to main.
