Implemented lazy loading for instant Miller startup matching Julie's pattern. Removed all background initialization from lifespan, converted tools to async with _ensure_initialized() guard, achieving instant connection (< 100ms) instead of 10-15 second delay. First tool call now triggers one-time 2-3 sec initialization.
