Completed strategic planning for Miller toolset. Created comprehensive TOOLS_PLAN.md documenting 8-tool strategy (down from Julie's 15). Research-backed decisions: MCPs as data gateways, search/replace > line editing, agents prefer built-in editing tools. Priorities: 1) Complete get_symbols, 2) Add fast_refs (refactoring safety), 3) Add trace_call_path (killer cross-language feature), 4) Add search_and_replace (proven usage). Skipping: line-based editing tools, possibly fast_goto. Documentation generation as workflow not tool. Ready to start implementation.
