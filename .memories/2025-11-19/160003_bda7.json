  "description": "Task 2.4 complete: Related symbols suggestions using embeddings. Computes cosine similarity between symbol embeddings to find top-5 similar symbols. Field: related_symbols (list with name and similarity). Excludes self. Perfect for code discovery. All 49 tests passing (Phase 1: 20, Task 2.1: 8, Task 2.2: 7, Task 2.3: 7, Task 2.4: 7). symbols.py coverage 52%.",
