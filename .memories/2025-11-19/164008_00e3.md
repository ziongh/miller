Tasks 1.1 & 1.2 complete: fast_refs foundation built with TDD! Database query foundation finds references by symbol name, filters by relationship kind (Call/Import/etc), groups by file, sorts by usage frequency. Context snippet extraction reads source files efficiently (once per file), shows actual code lines where symbols are used, handles missing files gracefully. All 7 tests passing (100% TDD). refs.py at 93% coverage (56 statements, 4 missed - error handling). Phase 1 foundation solid and production-ready for basic use cases.
