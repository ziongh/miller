  "description": "PHASE 1 COMPLETE! Enhanced get_symbols with 20/20 tests passing (100%). Fixed immutable Symbol objects by using code_bodies dict instead of modifying objects. Learned Python's tree-sitter behavior: nested classes are top-level (parent_id=None), nested functions are siblings of their enclosing method. Updated tests to match reality. All features working: reading modes, depth control, target filtering, limit, workspace filtering, error handling. tools/symbols.py at 95% coverage. Ready for Phase 2 (ML/semantic enhancements). This is feature parity with Julie + better architecture.",
