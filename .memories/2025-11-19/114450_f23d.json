  "description": "Investigated manage_workspace \"index\" operation after completing Phase 3. Analyzed Julie's comprehensive index implementation (handles primary + reference workspaces, locking, force reindex). Discovered Miller's scanner is created during _ensure_initialized() but never actually indexes - check_if_indexing_needed() and index_workspace() never called. Confirmed need for either: (1) implement index operation or (2) add auto-indexing to _ensure_initialized(). Primary workspace has no bootstrap mechanism currently.",
