Implemented Phase 1 of enhanced get_symbols (80% complete, 16/20 tests passing). Created comprehensive test suite with TDD approach. Implemented reading modes (structure/minimal/full), target filtering, limit parameter, workspace filtering. Known issues: minimal mode code body extraction and depth filtering (0-2) including extra symbols. Architecture: tools/symbols.py module with filtering/body extraction logic, enhanced server.py get_symbols signature. Major progress toward Miller's enhanced symbol navigation.
