  "description": "Completed manage_workspace tool by implementing missing 'index' operation (was declared but not implemented). Added full functionality: path resolution, workspace detection, staleness checking, force rebuild support, and registry updates. Enhanced all MCP tool descriptions (fast_search, manage_workspace) with indexing workflow explanations, operation clarifications, cross-references, and practical examples. All 8 workspace operations now working (list, stats, index, add, remove, refresh, clean, health). Tool descriptions complete and accurate.",
