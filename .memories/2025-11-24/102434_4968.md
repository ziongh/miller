Fixed multiple Windows-specific issues: SQLite threading (check_same_thread=False), Unicode encoding crash (utf-8 for file writes), added FlushingHandler for immediate log writes, and watchdog thread to detect stuck initialization. Changed requires-python to >=3.12 for Windows GPU (CUDA/DirectML) support.
