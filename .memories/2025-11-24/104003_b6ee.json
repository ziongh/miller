  "description": "Fixed Windows FTS index creation failures by adding retry logic with exponential backoff. Handles two Tantivy race conditions: (1) PermissionDenied file locking, (2) \"index writer was killed\" thread panic. Added 5 tests to verify retry behavior. Fix tested successfully on Windows - FTS index now creates without errors.",
