  "description": "Completed graph expansion feature for fast_search. Added expand=True parameter that enriches search results with direct callers/callees using reachability table (distance=1). Text format shows \u2190 Callers and \u2192 Callees with counts. All Tier 1 Game Changers now complete: re-ranker, transitive closure, graph expansion. 11 new tests, 672 total passing.",
