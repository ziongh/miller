  "description": "Optimized text search quality and token efficiency: Implemented field boosting, match position boosting, symbol kind weighting, and quality filtering. Routed text search to hybrid mode (semantic+FTS) for better results. Achieved 88% precision@5 (up from 46%) and 80% token savings through TOON format improvements (threshold 20\u21925, default output_format json\u2192auto, default limit 50\u219220). Created comprehensive benchmark suite to measure search quality improvements.",
