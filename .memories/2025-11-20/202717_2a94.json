  "description": "Core trace_call_path implementation complete. 10/10 unit tests passing. Traverses relationships in upstream/downstream/both directions. Max depth limiting (1-10). Cycle detection using visited sets. Output formats: JSON (TracePath dict) and tree (ASCII art). Statistics: languages_found, match_types, relationship_kinds, execution_time. Symbol lookup with optional context_file disambiguation. Next: enhance with naming variant matching for true cross-language tracing.",
