  "description": "Implemented naming variant generator for trace_call_path. 54/55 tests passing. Handles snake_case, camelCase, PascalCase, kebab-case conversion. Strips common prefixes (I, T, E, Base) and suffixes (Dto, Service, Model, etc.). English pluralization/singularization with irregular forms. Cross-language matching validated (TypeScript \u2194 Python \u2194 SQL). Known limitation: brand names with mixed casing (OAuth2) parse as separate words.",
