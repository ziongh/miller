Enhanced recall() with semantic search capability - now supports both fast filesystem scan (time-based) and intelligent hybrid text+semantic search (topic-based). Memory files automatically indexed by file watcher with embeddings, leveraging Miller's superior search engine. Tested and working - can now do /recall "cross-language tracing" to find memories by concept, not just keywords. This makes Miller's memory system better than Julie's file scanning.
