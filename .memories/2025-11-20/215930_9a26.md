Implemented parallel batch extraction using Rayon - extract_files_batch() releases GIL and uses all CPU cores for 2-4x faster indexing. Benchmarked at 27 files/sec (430 files in 15.91s) with tree-sitter taking only 0.28s (1.8% of total time). Cleaned up legacy Julie artifacts (.julie/, .julieignore). This makes Miller's indexing significantly faster than sequential extraction while keeping parsing overhead negligible.
