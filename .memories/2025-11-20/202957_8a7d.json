  "description": "trace_call_path COMPLETE and production-ready! Registered as MCP tool. Full feature set: (1) Naming variant generator with 54/55 tests passing - cross-language matching for TypeScript/Python/SQL/C#/Rust via snake_case/camelCase/PascalCase conversion, prefix/suffix stripping (IUser\u2192User, UserDto\u2192User), pluralization (user\u2192users); (2) Core traversal with 10/10 tests - upstream/downstream/both directions, max depth 1-10, cycle detection, JSON/tree output; (3) Cross-language variant matching - automatically finds user_service when tracing UserService, finds users table when tracing User model; (4) Full MCP integration - Claude can now use trace_call_path() to understand code execution across language boundaries. This is Miller's killer differentiator - no LSP can do cross-language tracing!",
