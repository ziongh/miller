  "description": "Phase 3 COMPLETE: Implemented embeddings layer with LanceDB + sentence-transformers. Created EmbeddingManager (GPU auto-detection, batch encoding, L2 normalization) and VectorStore (text/semantic/hybrid search). Tests: 74/75 passing (14/15 embeddings tests + 15/15 storage tests), 84% total coverage, embeddings.py at 87%. Uses BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5 model (384 dimensions). LanceDB handles all search (no FTS5). Performance: batch embedding working, search sub-second.",
