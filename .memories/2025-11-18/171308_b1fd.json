  "description": "Integrated file watcher into Miller server: Added real-time indexing via file watcher in lifespan handler. Server now: (1) starts immediately, (2) indexes workspace in background, (3) starts file watcher for live updates, (4) handles CREATED/MODIFIED/DELETED events automatically. Watcher ignores .git, *.pyc, __pycache__, node_modules, .miller. Graceful shutdown with watcher cleanup. Real-time code intelligence complete!",
