Connected Miller to GitHub repo (https://github.com/anortham/miller.git). Created initial commit with all Phase 1-3 code (288 files, 54K lines), added .gitignore and .gitattributes for LF line endings. Repository structure matches Julie's with .memories/ tracked in source control for checkpoint/recall persistence across sessions.
