Workspace indexing foundation complete: Added pathspec + tqdm dependencies, created ignore_patterns.py with .gitignore parsing (uses pathspec library), added get_all_files() to storage.py for incremental indexing. All TDD tests written and implementations complete. Next: Create WorkspaceScanner class to orchestrate file walking, change detection, and automatic indexing on server startup (adapting Julie's on_initialized pattern for Miller).
