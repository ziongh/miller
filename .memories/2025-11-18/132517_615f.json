  "description": "Deep analysis of COA CodeSearch Lucene.NET implementation reveals multi-field indexing + code-aware tokenization as keys to excellent code idiom search. Created comprehensive SEARCH_FOUNDATION_ANALYSIS.md documenting: (1) Multi-field strategy (content/symbols/patterns), (2) Smart query routing, (3) Custom CodeTokenizer for pattern preservation, (4) Current Miller gaps (no pattern field, English stemmer breaks code), (5) Proposed 4-phase implementation plan with pattern-preserving field as Phase 1 critical path. Ready to validate current limitations and implement pattern field POC.",
