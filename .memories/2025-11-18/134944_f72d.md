Improved Miller logging: Changed from single rotating log file (miller.log) to daily date-based log files (miller-YYYY-MM-DD.log). Uses TimedRotatingFileHandler with midnight rotation, keeps 30 days of logs by default. Benefits: (1) easier to find logs from specific days, (2) automatic cleanup of old logs, (3) prevents single log file from growing indefinitely. Updated logging_config.py and removed old log files.
