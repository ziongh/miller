  "description": "Miller MCP server fully debugged and production-ready: Fixed two critical bugs - (1) FK constraint failures by switching from absolute to relative Unix-style paths following Julie's pattern, (2) LanceDB PyArrow cast errors by adding explicit schema with nullable fields. Results verified: 304 files indexed (100% success vs 7.6% before), 3,858 symbols in SQLite, 3,859 vectors in LanceDB. Added date-based logging (miller-YYYY-MM-DD.log). All tests passing, databases verified with actual data queries.",
