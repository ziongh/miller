  "description": "Added comprehensive performance timing and logging to workspace indexing. Tracks and reports: file discovery time, tree-sitter extraction time, embedding generation time, database write time, cleanup time, and overall throughput (files/sec). Logs progress every 50 files. Displays percentage breakdown showing where time is spent. Enables direct performance comparison with Julie. New _index_file_timed() method instruments each indexing phase separately.",
