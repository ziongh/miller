Shipped Miller memory tools! Complete TDD implementation: 24/24 tests passing, full Julie compatibility, slash commands created, refactored to DRY principles. Committed 1592 lines across 12 files and pushed to main. Miller can now dogfood itself - using its own checkpoint/recall/plan system. Ready for production use.
