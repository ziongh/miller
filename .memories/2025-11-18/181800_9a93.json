  "description": "Completed TDD implementation of checkpoint/recall/plan MCP tools in Miller with 100% Julie compatibility. Phase 1 (RED): Wrote 24 comprehensive failing tests covering checkpoint creation (8 tests), recall filtering (7 tests), and plan management (9 tests). Phase 2 (GREEN): Implemented memory_utils.py helper functions (ID generation, git context capture, slugification) and tools/memory.py with all three MCP tools. All tests now passing (24/24, 100%). Features: Same JSON schema as Julie, same file naming (HHMMSS_XXXX.json), same directory structure (.memories/YYYY-MM-DD/), same ID format ({type}_{8hex}_{6hex}), git context capture, tag normalization, single-active-plan enforcement. Ready for Phase 3: Register MCP tools in server.py and Phase 4: Integration tests with Julie compatibility validation.",
