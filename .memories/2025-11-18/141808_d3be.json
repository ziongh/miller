  "description": "Fixed Miller MCP startup crash: Removed invalid request_timeout parameter from FastMCP.__init__() and suppressed stdout/stderr during SentenceTransformer model loading. FastMCP doesn't accept request_timeout (was causing TypeError). SentenceTransformer writes download progress to stdout which breaks MCP JSON-RPC protocol. Solution: (1) Removed request_timeout=300 from FastMCP initialization, (2) Wrapped model loading with redirect_stdout/redirect_stderr to os.devnull. Tests pass, server starts cleanly, databases created successfully (symbols.db + vectors.lance).",
