  "description": "Fixed Miller MCP timeout disconnections: Added request_timeout=300 (5 minutes) to FastMCP initialization. Default 60-second timeout was too short for Miller's ML/indexing workload. Unlike Julie/Sherpa (pure Rust, fast responses), Miller does heavy work: startup indexing (10-20s), embedding generation, vector storage. The 60s timeout caused disconnections during idle periods after indexing. Now configured for 5-minute timeout to handle long-running operations gracefully.",
