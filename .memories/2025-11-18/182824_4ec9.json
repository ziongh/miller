  "description": "Refactoring Complete: Extracted reusable JSON I/O helpers to eliminate duplication. Created write_json_file() and read_json_file() in memory_utils.py to centralize Julie-compatible JSON formatting (indent=2, sort_keys, trailing newline, directory creation). Refactored tools/memory.py to use helpers throughout checkpoint/recall/plan functions. Results: 13+ code repetitions eliminated, 12 lines removed (987→975), memory_utils.py coverage increased 53%→80%, tools/memory.py 85%→83%. All 24 tests still passing (100% GREEN). Code now follows DRY principle - single source of truth for JSON I/O. Next: Phase 4B validation (Julie compatibility testing, integration tests, documentation).",
