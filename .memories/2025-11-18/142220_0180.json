  "description": "Fixed Miller MCP connection issue: Removed blocking startup indexing and suppressed FastMCP banner. Two bugs prevented connection: (1) FastMCP printed ASCII banner to stdout which breaks JSON-RPC protocol - fixed by adding show_banner=False to mcp.run(), (2) Startup indexing ran synchronously BEFORE server started accepting connections, causing 30s delay and connection timeouts - fixed by removing blocking asyncio.run(startup_indexing()) and implementing lazy indexing that runs on first search. Server now starts immediately and responds to MCP initialize within 1 second.",
