  "description": "Implemented file watcher with watchdog library: 23/30 tests passing (77%). Core functionality works: start/stop lifecycle, file creation detection, debouncing, ignore patterns, Unicode/space filenames, error handling. Remaining failures are watchdog platform quirks (modify vs create events). 520 lines of implementation (FileWatcher + DebounceQueue + event handler).",
