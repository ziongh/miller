  "description": "Implemented Julie's hash-based incremental indexing for large codebase performance: (1) Fast-path staleness check - compares DB mtime vs max file mtime to skip expensive hash checks when workspace unchanged, (2) Fixed critical O(n²) bug where _needs_indexing() called get_all_files() in a loop - now builds O(1) lookup map once, (3) Set-based new file detection using workspace_files - db_files. Startup indexing check now ~50ms instead of seconds. Unchanged workspaces detected instantly via mtime. Cross-platform path handling uses relative Unix-style paths. 12/13 workspace tests passing.",
