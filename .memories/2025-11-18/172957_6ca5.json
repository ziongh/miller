  "description": "Created 6-phase plan to replace Miller's basic LIKE query text search with LanceDB's Tantivy FTS. Discovered current text search uses string interpolation (SQL injection risk) with no BM25 ranking or stemming. Plan covers FTS index creation, hybrid search with RRF fusion, incremental indexing, and file watcher integration. Expected benefits: 10-100x faster search, BM25 relevance ranking, security fix, English stemming support.",
