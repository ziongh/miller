  "description": "Phase 4 partial: Created FastMCP server (server.py, 267 lines) with 4 MCP tools (index_file, fast_search, fast_goto, get_symbols). Tests: 6/25 passing. Issues: miller_core import timing, async tool registration. Need to fix imports and get remaining tests passing. Server architecture complete, just needs debugging.",
