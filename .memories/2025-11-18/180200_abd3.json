  "description": "Created comprehensive TDD plan for implementing checkpoint/recall/plan tools in Miller with 100% backward compatibility with Julie's .memories system. Plan includes 4 phases: (1) Test Design - write 24 failing tests first covering checkpoint creation, recall filtering, plan management, and backward compatibility, (2) Implementation - create memory_utils.py helpers + implement 3 MCP tools following exact Julie schemas, (3) Validation - verify Miller reads Julie checkpoints and vice versa, (4) Integration - full lifecycle tests + documentation. Key requirements: Same JSON schema, file naming (HHMMSS_XXXX.json), directory structure (.memories/YYYY-MM-DD/), ID format ({type}_{8hex}_{6hex}), and git context capture. Estimated 8 hours of TDD development. Goal: Enable dogfooding Miller to replace Julie while maintaining full .memories compatibility.",
