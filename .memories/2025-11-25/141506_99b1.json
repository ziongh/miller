  "description": "Created 3 pattern detection skills: detect-n-plus-one.md (finds loop+query patterns), detect-empty-catch.md (finds swallowed exceptions), detect-hardcoded-secrets.md (security scan for exposed credentials). Skills are language-agnostic using Miller's semantic search. Each includes activation announcement for visual feedback, structured output format, and language-specific hints.",
