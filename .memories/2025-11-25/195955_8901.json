  "description": "Fixed stale file detection bug in check_if_indexing_needed(). The old MAX-based heuristic compared MAX(last_indexed) from all files to max(code_file_mtime), which could miss stale code files when a non-code file (.memories/*.json) was indexed more recently. New per-file approach compares each file's mtime to its own last_indexed timestamp. Added regression test, removed dead _get_max_file_mtime method. All 756 tests pass.",
