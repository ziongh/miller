  "description": "Completed Miller performance optimization sprint: (1) Single-pass file discovery - scan_workspace() replaces 3 separate rglob walks, reducing ~30K stat calls to ~10K on large workspaces. (2) Batch inserts in incremental_update_atomic() using executemany() instead of row-by-row - 10-100x faster for large files. (3) Batch search hydration - 20 queries \u2192 1 query. (4) Batch search expansion - ~240 queries \u2192 3 queries when expand=True. (5) Added composite reachability indexes for distance filtering. (6) Batch file cleanup - N commits \u2192 1 commit. All 747 tests pass.",
