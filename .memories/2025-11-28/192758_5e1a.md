CI workflow fully working! All builds and tests pass on macOS, Ubuntu, and Windows. Key fixes: (1) manylinux_2_28 instead of 2_17 to fix undefined symbol le16toh from tree-sitter grammars, (2) --no-deps to avoid installing heavy ML dependencies for smoke test, (3) shell: python to bypass PowerShell string mangling, (4) removed error-swallowing __init__.py import for clear diagnostics.
