Major session: (1) Reviewed Windows fixes in commit 601b8f2, found asyncio.to_thread regression affecting all platforms, fixed with platform detection (Unix=threaded, Windows=sync). (2) Merged PR #1 stdio hardening with post-merge fixes (null safety, comments). (3) Bumped julie-extractors to v1.19.0 for frontmatter support. (4) Implemented issue #2: memories now stored as Markdown with YAML frontmatter instead of JSON. Migrated 227 files, added pyyaml dependency, updated checkpoint/recall/plan tools, added migration docs to CLAUDE.md. All tests passing.
