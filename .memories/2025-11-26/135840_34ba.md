Reviewed and committed Gemini's changes: per-file locking in WorkspaceScanner to prevent race conditions from concurrent file watcher events, and TODO.md cleanup of resolved issues (Lance path error, duplicates). Lock striping pattern is correct - serializes same-file indexing while keeping parallelism for different files.
