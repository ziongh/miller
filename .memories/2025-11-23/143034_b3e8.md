Implemented transitive closure for fast impact analysis. Added reachability table to schema, BFS-based closure computation (closure.py), storage methods (can_reach, get_distance, etc.), and integrated with indexing pipeline. All 17 reachability tests + 19 storage tests pass. Closure computed after workspace indexing.
