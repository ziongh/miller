Completed re-ranker feature fully. Benchmarked performance (10-42ms for 10-100 results, sub-linear scaling). Demonstrated relevance improvement via manual testing ("authentication logic" query correctly promotes auth-related results). Updated docstrings with accurate latency (~20-50ms). Added concise re-ranker docs to instructions.md. No TODOs remaining, logging appropriate. All success criteria met.
