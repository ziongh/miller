  "description": "Completed re-ranker implementation session. Tested live - cross-encoder scores working correctly. Benchmarked performance (~33ms for 50 results). Discussed embedding model options from Gemini suggestions (bge-small vs codebert vs bge-m3) - concluded current bge-small + re-ranker combo is solid since bi-encoder handles recall and re-ranker handles precision.",
